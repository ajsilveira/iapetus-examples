## Manifest

* `arg/` - arginine (compound 2 from [1])
* `glu/` - glutamate (not the same as compound 3 [glycine-glutamate] reported in [1])
* `his_posit` - histidine (positively charged, doubly protonated)
* `his_neut` - histidine (neutral, protonated at epsilon carbon)
* `imi/` - imipenem (compound 5 in [1] except stereochemistry inverted at C)
* `mero/` - meropenem (compound 4 in [1] except stereochemistry inverted at C15)
* `comp7` - compound 7 from [1]
* `comp8` - compound 8 from [1]
